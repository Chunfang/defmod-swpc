## DESCRIPTION
This code combines two open source codes Defmod(-dev) and OpenSWPC, forming an FE-FD mixed code. 

To install and use the "pure" FE or FD code, visit   
https://bitbucket.org/stali/defmod    
https://github.com/takuto-maeda/OpenSWPC

To install and run this "mixed" code, see doc/INSTALL

## FEATURES
1. Forward incremental Lagrange Multiplier method for modeling fault slip honoring slip weakening and rate-and-state frictional laws, verified with SCEC benchmark problems.
2. Adaptive (Quasi-)static-dynamic "hybrid" (FE) solver that covers multi-temporal scales, e.g. fault slip (fast) triggered by pore pressure changes (slow).  
3. Finite element and finite difference coupling that covers multi-spatial scales, e.g. localized fault slip and resulting ground motions. 
4. Generalized-alpha (implicit dynamic) solver that is unconditionally stable, i.e. does not suffer CFL restriction, while allowing fault rupture.
