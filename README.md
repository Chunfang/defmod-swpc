## DESCRIPTION
This code combines two open source codes Defmod(-dev) and OpenSWPC, forming an FE-FD mixed code. 

To install and use the "pure" FE or FD code, visit   
https://bitbucket.org/stali/defmod    
https://github.com/takuto-maeda/OpenSWPC

To install and run this "mixed" code, see doc/INSTALL

## FEATURES
1. Forward incremental Lagrange Multiplier method for modeling fault slip honoring slip weakening and rate-and-state frictional laws, verified with SCEC benchmark problems.
2. Adaptive (Quasi-)static-dynamic "hybrid" (FE) solver that covers multi-temporal scales, e.g. fault slip (fast) triggered by pore pressure changes (slow).  
3. Finite element and finite difference coupling that covers multi-spatial scales, e.g. localized fault slip and resulting ground motions. 
4. Generalized-alpha (implicit dynamic) solver that is unconditionally stable, i.e. does not suffer CFL restriction, while allowing fault rupture.  
5. (Partially) synchrize FE domain pressure/permeability with a finite volume code [pflotran](https://bitbucket.org/pflotran/pflotran/wiki/Home).

## Example descriptions
* F3D, slip on curved fault induced by increasing differential loading, 3D domain.
* F2Dp, production fluctuation and rate-and-state friction scenarios, 2D domain.
* F3Dp, production induced rupture on curved fault, 3D domain.
* F3Db (F3Db\_usg for unstructured and shared FV/FE mesh), minimalistic example of injection induced fault slip to demonstrate FV(pflotran)->FE(defmod)->FD(swpc) binding, 3D domain, transient and tensor valued permeability. To activate FV-FE binding, launch defmod with -fv [argv]:
    * -fv 1: structured FV single phase;
    * -fv 2: structured FV multiphase;
    * -fv 3: unstructured FV single phase;
    * -fv 4: unstructured FV multiphase.
* HF3D, injection induced rupture on splay fault, 3D domain (modified from SCEC14/15).
* FE, legacy examples including Mandel (2D/3D) benchmarks.
* SCEC, SCEC problems number 10, 102 and 205, waveforms produced by both the FE and FD modules.
* F3DX, Modified SCEC problems number 14 and 15 to have intersecting faults.
* SCEC2D, SCEC 2D problems number 10, 11 and 102 to compare hybrid (implicit-explicit) models against generalized-alpha (implicit dynamic) models. 
* CR3D, a 3D equivalent to [Cappa and Rutqvist 2011](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011GL048487) model, demonstrating the FV->FE->FD workflow, follow [README](https://github.com/Chunfang/defmod-swpc/blob/master/example/CR3D) to execute.\
Examples F3D, F3Db, F2Dp, SCEC2D and FE can run on a desktop computer, while others shall run on a cluster. The execution commands are equivalent for both the desktop and cluster, see <model>.sh files for details.
